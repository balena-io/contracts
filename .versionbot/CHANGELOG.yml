        - The Jetson TX2 NX has an eMMC and no SD-CARD slot

        - The JN30B Nano uses the eMMC module and not the SD-CARD one

        - The Radxa CM3 on RPI CM4 IOBoard as well as the Radxa zero use
          rockchip software tools in order to put the eMMC in mass-storage mode
        - The CM4 module comes in two flavors: one with eMMC and the Lite
        version
          which uses the carrier board sd-card slot to load the image. Both use the
          same balenaOS image.
          I switched the storage to internal for this DT because it *may* have
          one, but this solely depends on the actual module.
          Another consideration is that this DT can also boot from a USB stick
          or a NVME drive connected to the mPCIE port.

    - subject: Remove `Device` and `Device-type` from base image detail messages
- commits:
    - body: >-
        In our build process, we create groups of all identical base images and
        for each group, just one image is built while others are created by
        doing `docker tag` so the `Device` and `Device-type` on the tagged
        images are not correct.

        Users already know the device name from the base image name so these
        information are not really important and we should remove them from the
        messages, otherwise it can be confusing for users.

        Debian Jessie is now LTS so `-updates` repository is removed from all
        mirrors, this fix will remove it from sources.list as a workaround until
        it is fixed upstream.

        Aarch64 will use archive.debian.org instead of normal mirrors since only
        Jessie i386, amd64, armel and armhf will continue to be hosted on the
        normal mirrors.
